800 wasps assemble.
800 wasps, go.
A valiant effort, but alas...the mission was not completed with success.
Am I going to make it?
Am I wrinkly, Robert?
Anyway, Robert - we've missed you. Me and the mafia.
Apparently it's not legal to launder 17,000 dollar through a locally owned Greek restaurant.

Can you pay for it?
Can you triple it?

Classic fresh and nice shampoo.
Click the link, Robert. Click the link.

Do you know if they restocked the Ginger Ale?
Do you like Golden Corral?
Do you like chicken noodle soup?
Do you like needles? Like the pokey kind. Not the round kind.
Do you like rigatoni pasta? I want your honest opinion.
Do you like rigatoni?
Do you like the moisturizer I've been using.
Do you not like Arby's?
Do you sell steroids? I need steroids. A lot of steroids.
Do you think I'm cute? Be honest.
Do you think these would be nice for the fellas back home?
Do you think they sell Q-tips around here? I've been needing some.
Don't be mean to me.
Don't do that. Stop doing this. This guy fucked the fish.
Don't fuck my asshole.
Don't fuck them - you're a fish fucker. You fucked the fish. I saw what you did to that fish.
Don't look at me like that.
Don't make me mad, Robert.
Don't mess with the Jimmy Big Balls and the Sinaloa Cartel funny boys.
Don't worry, I got the stash in this pretty cool sink.
Don't worry, I'll keep quiet about it. I know you've had it for years - your chronic hemorrhoid issue.
Don't worry, Robert, they won't suspect a thing.
Don't worry, they have erectile dysfunction too. No need to feel alone, big guy.
Don't yell at me. I'm sensitive.
Donde esta la biblioteca? Por favor. No puedo encontrar la biblioteca.

Goodbye, Robert. I'll see you next time.
Got all mad at me for dry humping their rotisserie chicken. I fucked it.
Got to stay on your toes.
Got you a good deal.
Hang on. I need to get my Toyota Camry.
Have you tried the Costco rotisserie chicken?
Have you tried the Moon Juice? Or perhaps the Diet Moon Juice?
He got me real good in the leg.
He has a plastic explosive and detonator.
He made a big nana with the cartel, Robert.
He's doing his best. He's a convicted felon.
He's fat. Quite plump.
He's grabbing my little toes.
Hello, Robert.
Help. The pain.
Hold this.
How about some pistachios?
How have you been?
How is your night going?
How's your day been.
I accidentally fueled my Toyota Camry with 1% low fat milk.
I almost got into an accident.
I am a sardine.
I am mildly dissatisfied at this particular moment.
I am the fish.
I am the president.
I bought some windshield wiper fluid from Target today.
I can throw it back crazy style if you need.
I can't find my Doritos spicy sweet chili tortilla chips.
I can't get down, it's scary.
I can't get down, it's too high.
I can't get in the garage.
I can't let them find the canned chicken noodle soup.
I crashed the New York stock exchange from the upstairs computer.
I don't care.
I don't have insurance.
I don't know how to land the helicopter.
I don't know where to go.
I don't like this one.
I don't like this rock. Robert, it's pissing me off.
I don't think the IRS is very happy with me.
I don't want the Doritos.
I embody true spider power. It's coursing through me, Robert.
I feel better now.
I give you a little kiss.
I got afraid.
I got some green stuff on my finger again. I'm a little sad about it.
I got the moves, Robert. Boopity bop.
I got this for you.
I got this, be sneaky.
I got this.
I hate you, stupid.
I have a 25% off coupon for canned soup.
I have caused immeasurable damage to the deli meat section.
I have to meet with Little Doopy and them Boiz.
I hope I'm not intruding.
I hope they have corn chips.
I hope we can start a new life together. A new house. Family of our own.
I know it gets to you some time. The erectile dysfunction that is. You got it real bad, don't you.
I know the ancient Babylonians built this structure. It can't hold up forever.
I legally can't go back to Michigan, Robert.
I like the spicy ones.
I like this man.
I like to jay ride on the smoked turkey.

I need more fish oils.
I need to call the insurance company.
I need to do a tire change. I need the tool.
I remember it like it was yesterday. The 1976 bathtub soup.
I require it, Robert.
I set my GPS route to the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
I take the bus, Robert.
I think I fit.
I think my kidneys can function in this state.
I think this is Detroit.
I think you're overreacting.
I told you it's a nice place.
I will commit a home invasion now.
I will douse you in gasoline and ignite it into a fiery sacrificial display of immolation for my own satisfaction. You stupid idiotically vermin.
I will now go harass the nearest Circle K store clerk.
I will now go launder 17,000 dollars through a locally owned Greek restaurant.
I wonder if they have hemorrhoid cream around here
I would like the Tiramisu please.
I would like to go to Hell again.
I'll take two policies. Two insurance policies.
I'm 42. And one-half.
I'm alone.
I'm banned from entry. They don't like that thing I did. The little boop dee wop. Dee bee dee boo boo.
I'm doing my best.
I'm getting gas.
I'm going to fuck you.
I'm going to go invade a small but moderately populated island nation.
I'm going to go remove South Carolina.
I'm going to shoot this one.
I'm going to the bus stop. I'll be back.
I'm going to use your bathroom.
I'm gonna head out, good night.
I'm here looking for the nearest Walgreens.
I'm here to make amends with the cartel.
I'm here to warn you of the deep sea mollusks. They're up to no good. Oh those things.
I'm here undercover working with the FSB.
I'm hiding. They got Calamari Joe in my ass.
I'm in agony, Robert Malecki.
I'm in agony.
I'm looking for him. He's been on my radar. Trace them into this location.
I'm looking for my anal lump medication.
I'm mildly irritated, Robert. Very irritated.
I'm no longer blind.
I'm now a legal citizen of the People's Republic of China.
I'm off to find hemorrhoid cream.
I'm on a mission.
I'm really excited to see you, Robert.
I'm scared.
I'm sorry Robert, I gotta go cause a violent uprising at the nearest deep sea oil rig.
I'm sorry Robert, give me a kiss.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.
I'm the defendant in an ongoing $3.6 million dollars lawsuit, Robert.
I'm trying to get some ginger ale for his little tummy ache.
I've always been a fish.
I've been meaning to make some rigatoni pasta.
I've captured a cartel member, Robert.
I've determined I can no longer utilize my sense of taste effectively.
I've failed, Robert.
I've missed your ladder.
I've tracked him coincidentally. To the region in which your most land purchase was.
I've tried putting this thing in my anus...it didn't work.
If anyone finds out, oh, I'm about a spooky bop bop bitey bitty bop bop bop bop on they ass.
In the end, what matters? Nothing, right? So you make it for yourself. You make your rigatoni pasta. Your canned chicken noodle soup. 25% off coupon at Walgreens. Your moon juice, Robert.
It came from the portal.
It is illegitimate and fraudulent. Entirely unacceptable.
It isn't working, Robert. There is milk in the fuel tank.
It left a mark, can you check it for me, Robert? Is it bad?
It was an honest mistake.
It's a sad life, Robert Malecki.
It's about living in the shoes of the people, Robert. The everyday working man.
It's about the hardships we endure.
It's been a long time. I've been in Moldova, you see.
It's been really hard these days, after losing my Doritos sweet spicy chili tortilla chips.
It's my time to serve the country.
It's not so simple, Robert.
It's not the same.
It's not what you would have expected. The spider on the shelf. The hair on the palm. It's a fuzzy one. 
It's not working.
It's ok, I'll keep it quiet.
It's on your IP Address.
It's rumbly.
It's time to feast, Robert.
It's time to talk, Robert.
Jimbo James got out, Robert. The Mafia got him out of El Salvador prison.
Jimbo James, we've got to get out of here.
Jimbo James...I need to find him.
Kitty.
Let me park.
Levitation magic - I learned it from the wizard school.
Listen here Robert, I know you might be skeptical. This one's a keeper.

My time has come to an end, Robert. I have to go back to Moldova.
My turn.
Nah.
New Orleans.
No, I don't.
No, not really.
No, we probably won't.
No, you can't.
Not too rough, just moderately course. It's important to moisturize.
Nothing, it kind of sucked.
Now I'm all sad.
Oh it's tickling me, Robert. 
Oh no, Robert. He is here. Oh no.
Oh no, not the tractor beam.
Oh no, not the tractor beam. They got me.
Oh no, they're going to take me away. 
Oh no. Oh, we're out of time.
Oh no...not this skibble-wibble-wibby-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-boo.
Oh oh, oh baby. Oh no.
Oh the great Polinki. The great publicity bob benji benji boo.
Oh, I didn't see you there.
Oh, baby. Wibby wobble wibby. Wow.
Oh, goody.
Oh, my skin. It's quite moisturized, you know? I used a nice moisturizer. I got it online. It burns.
Oh, so rumbly. Even grumbly.
Oh.
Okay.
Out of my way. I've got some doo doo coming out.
Patrick Pinkleton and the Paper Towel Cartel just overthrew the Malaysian government.
